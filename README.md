# WarbandAccountant
**Warband Accountant** is a World of Warcraft addon that automates gold management across your Warband, allowing you to set precise target amounts for each character so excess funds automatically deposit to (or deficits withdraw from) your Warband Bank whenever opened. Whether you need every alt to maintain exactly 10,000g for repairs or want your main flush with crafting capital, the addon eliminates manual micromanagement by ensuring each character carries exactly what you specify without constant bag-checking.

Built with LibDBIcon for seamless integration with minimap button managers like MinimapButtonBag Reborn and SexyMap, the addon features per-character target configuration through an intuitive scrollable interface, session-based profit/loss tracking, and flexible access via `/wba` commands or the Blizzard Options panel. Automatic transfers can operate silently or with confirmation dialogs, giving you complete control over your Warband's wealth distribution without disrupting your gameplay flow.
